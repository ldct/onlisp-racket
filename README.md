# onlisp-racket
On Lisp in Racket (scheme)

## Pre-preface

This is a port of Paul Graham's On Lisp to Racket, because I don't really want to learn CL just to read the book. Although I specify Racket here, I mainly do so in order to specify unambiguously some implementation of Scheme, rather than in order to use the non-scheme language features of Racket. Hence, I will try to make sure all the code works in any R5RS Scheme..

## Preface

This book is intended for anyone who wants to become a better Lisp programmer. It assumes some familiarity with Lisp, but not necessarily extensive programming experience. The first few chapters contain a fair amount of review. I hope that these sections will be interesting to more experienced Lisp programmers as well, because they present familiar subjects in a new light.

It's difficult to convey the essence of a programminglanguage in one sentence, but John Foderaro has come close:

Lisp is a programmable programming language. 

There is more to Lisp than this, but the ability to bend Lisp to oneâ€™s will is a large part of what distinguishes a Lisp expert from a novice. As well as writing their programs down toward the language, experienced Lisp programmers build the language up toward their programs. This book teaches how to program in the bottom-up style for which Lisp is inherently well-suited.
